description: Render Mermaid diagrams in your app.
---

Use `render()` to generate SVG or `mount()` to display a diagram that adapts to its container. Both are synchronous. The [lazy entry point](#imports) loads diagram types asynchronously.

## Usage

Pass Mermaid syntax to `render()` and insert the returned SVG into your page.

```ts
import { render } from 'pele';

const { svg } = render(`flowchart LR
  A[Mermaid text] --> B[SVG]`);

document.querySelector('#diagram').innerHTML = svg;
```

`supports()` checks whether a diagram type is available. Catch `PeleError` to handle syntax errors and other rendering failures.

```ts
import { PeleError, render, supports } from 'pele';

function draw(source: string, element: HTMLElement) {
  if (!supports(source)) return false;
  try {
    element.innerHTML = render(source).svg;
  } catch (error) {
    if (!(error instanceof PeleError)) throw error;
    element.textContent = error.message;
  }
  return true;
}
```

Error messages include diagram source. Display them with `textContent`. See [Security](/security) for handling untrusted diagrams.

## Imports

The main entry point includes every diagram type. Import individual types or load them on demand to reduce the initial bundle size.

| Import | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `pele` | API and all diagram types. |
| `pele/core` | API without diagram types. Add types with `register()`. |
| `pele/diagrams/<type>` | One diagram type, as the default export. `<type>` is a name that [`detectType()`](#detecttype) returns, such as `flowchart` or `sequence`. |
| `pele/lazy` | API with asynchronous loading. |

Register the types you need:

```ts
import { register, render } from 'pele/core';
import flowchart from 'pele/diagrams/flowchart';
import sequence from 'pele/diagrams/sequence';

register(flowchart, sequence);

const { svg } = render(source);
```

Use `pele/lazy` to load each type on first use. `renderAsync()` takes the same arguments as `render()` and returns a promise.

```ts
import { renderAsync } from 'pele/lazy';

const { svg } = await renderAsync(source);
```

`load(type)` loads a type without rendering and resolves to `false` for unsupported types. After loading, `render()` from the same module renders synchronously.

With `core` and `lazy`, [`supports()`](#supports) is `true` only for types that are registered or loaded. Use one of these entry points throughout an app. The main entry point has a separate registry.

## render

```ts
function render(text: string, options?: RenderOptions): RenderResult
```

Parses Mermaid text, lays out the diagram, and returns it as an SVG string. Throws a [`PeleError`](#peleerror) if the text cannot be rendered.

The same text, options, and font measurements always produce the same SVG.

### RenderOptions

All options are optional.

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `measurer` | `TextMeasurer` | Measures label text. Defaults to a canvas measurer in browsers and a built-in width table elsewhere. See [Text measurement](#text-measurement). |
| `fontFamily` | `string` | Font used to measure labels, and to draw them unless `--pele-font` is set. Defaults to `sans-serif`. [`mount()`](#mount) reads it from CSS. See [Fonts](/theming#fonts). |
| `fontFamilyMono` | `string` | The same for monospace labels and `--pele-font-mono`. Defaults to `monospace`. |
| `fontSize` | `number` | Base font size in pixels. Defaults to `16`. |
| `idPrefix` | `string` | Prefix for accessibility title and description IDs. Use a unique prefix for each diagram on a page. |
| `responsive` | `boolean` | Shrinks the SVG to fit a container narrower than the diagram. It never grows past its natural size. Defaults to `true`. Set `false` for a fixed pixel size. A diagram that sets Mermaid's `useMaxWidth: false` is also fixed. |
| `maxWidth` | `number` | Available width in pixels. Supported layouts adapt to this width without scaling down labels. See [Narrow screens](#narrow-screens). |
| `autoDirection` | `boolean` | Switches supported horizontal diagrams to a vertical layout when they exceed `maxWidth`. Defaults to `true`. |
| `directionBreakpoint` | `number` | Width threshold in pixels for `autoDirection`. Defaults to `640`. |
| `now` | `number \| Date` | Reference time for Gantt today markers and tasks without a start date. Defaults to the current time. |
| `padding` | `number` | Space around the diagram in pixels. |
| `limit` | `number` | Maximum length of `text` in characters. The default is 50,000, as in Mermaid. Longer input throws a `PeleError` with the code `limit`. Pass `Infinity` for no limit. |
| `outputLimit` | `number` | Maximum length of the SVG in characters. The default is 4,000,000. A larger diagram throws a `PeleError` with the code `limit`. Pass `Infinity` for no limit. |
| `maxEdges` | `number` | Maximum number of edges in a flowchart. The default is 5,000. A diagram with more throws a `PeleError` with the code `limit`. Diagram configuration cannot change it. Pass `Infinity` for no limit. |
| `linkSchemes` | `string[]` | URL schemes a link may use. The default is `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`. Relative addresses are always kept. See [Security](/security#links-and-images). |
| `imageSchemes` | `string[]` | URL schemes an image may use. The default is `['http', 'https']`. |
| `icons` | `(name: string) => string \| null \| undefined` | Returns the inner SVG markup for an icon name such as `fa:fa-car`. Icons without markup are omitted. The markup is inserted without filtering, so return only markup you trust. |
| `config` | `object` | Mermaid configuration. Frontmatter and directives in the text take precedence over it. |

### RenderResult

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `svg` | `string` | The diagram as an `<svg>` element. |
| `width` | `number` | Natural width of the diagram in pixels. |
| `height` | `number` | Height of the diagram in pixels. |
| `type` | `DiagramType` | The detected diagram type, such as `'flowchart'`. |
| `links` | `LinkInfo[]` | Diagram links for attaching navigation handlers. |

Each `LinkInfo` has the `id` of the node that carries the link, its `href`, and `internal`. A node with a `click` link is reported with `internal: false`. A node with the class `internal-link` is reported with `internal: true` and its label text as the `href`. An address that is [not allowed](/security#links-and-images) is reported as `about:blank`.

### Narrow screens

Scaling a diagram to fit a narrow container can make labels too small to read. Pass `maxWidth` to adapt supported layouts while preserving the font size:

```ts
const { svg } = render(source, { maxWidth: container.clientWidth });
```

Layout changes depend on the diagram type:

| Diagram | When it does not fit |
| --- | --- |
| Sankey, XY chart, treemap, Gantt | Fits the available width |
| Pie, radar | Fits the available width, with the legend below the chart |
| Kanban | Columns fold into rows |
| Mindmap | Switches to an indented outline. See [Direction](#direction). |
| Quadrant chart, Wardley map | Reduces width while preserving space for labels |
| Flowchart, class, state, entity relationship, requirement, use case, agentflow, timeline, git graph | Switches to a vertical layout. See [Direction](#direction). |
| Flowchart, class | Reduces spacing between nodes and around groups |
| Other types | Keeps the original layout |

#### Direction

When a diagram exceeds `maxWidth` and the available width is below 640 pixels, supported horizontal layouts switch to a vertical layout if that reduces their width. For example, `flowchart LR` renders as `flowchart TB`.

Set `autoDirection: false` to preserve the source direction. Use `directionBreakpoint` to change the width threshold. Subgraph directions, vertical diagrams, and swimlanes retain their direction.

[`mount()`](#mount) measures the container and re-renders when its width changes. With `render()`, handle width changes yourself.

## mount

```ts
function mount(element: HTMLElement, text: string, options?: MountOptions): Mounted
```

Renders a diagram into an element and adapts the layout when the container is resized.

```ts
import { mount } from 'pele';

const diagram = mount(container, source);
```

`mount()` automatically:

- Measures labels using `--pele-font` and `--pele-font-mono`, or the container font if they are not set. The `fontFamily` and `fontFamilyMono` options override this.
- Uses the container width as [`maxWidth`](#narrow-screens), unless a value is supplied.
- Re-renders when a width change affects the layout, and when a web font finishes loading.
- Lets a diagram that was shrunk to fit be zoomed and panned. See [Zoom](#zoom).

Call `update()` after a CSS change that affects fonts, such as a theme or font setting.

Use a container with a width independent of its content, such as a block element. `mount()` throws a [`PeleError`](#peleerror) as `render()` does.

`MountOptions` extends [`RenderOptions`](#renderoptions) with:

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `onRender` | `(result: RenderResult) => void` | Called after each render. Use it to attach link handlers or other SVG interactions. |
| `zoom` | `boolean \| 'auto' \| ZoomOptions` | Whether the diagram can be zoomed and panned. `'auto'`, the default, allows it for a diagram that was shrunk to fit. `true` allows it for every diagram. `false` turns it off. Pass [`ZoomOptions`](#zoom) to configure it. |

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `result` | Current `RenderResult`. |
| `zoom` | The diagram's [`Zoom`](#zoom), or `undefined` if the `zoom` option is `false`. |
| `update(text, options?)` | Updates the source or options and returns the new result. Call it after moving the container to another window. |
| `destroy()` | Stops observing the container and font loading. Leaves the diagram in place. |

With [`pele/lazy`](#imports), `mountAsync()` takes the same arguments, fetches the diagram type first, and returns a promise.

### Zoom

A zoomed diagram keeps the size of its box. The SVG shows part of the diagram at a larger scale, so nothing around it moves.

A diagram that can be zoomed has buttons to zoom in, zoom out, and reset.

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Pinch, or `Ctrl`/`⌘` + wheel | Zoom at the pointer |
| Drag | Pan a zoomed diagram |
| Double-click | Zoom in, or reset |
| `+` `-` `0` and arrow keys | Zoom, reset, and pan when the diagram has focus |

The wheel without a modifier key scrolls the page. On touch screens, one finger scrolls the page until the diagram is zoomed.

`enableZoom()` adds the same behavior to an SVG already in the page, such as one from `render()`.

```ts
function enableZoom(element: HTMLElement, options?: ZoomOptions): Zoom
```

```ts
import { enableZoom, render } from 'pele';

container.innerHTML = render(source).svg;
const zoom = enableZoom(container);
```

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `always` | `boolean` | Allows zoom for a diagram that fits its container. Defaults to `false`. |
| `maxScale` | `number` | Largest scale, where `1` is the diagram's natural size. Defaults to `3`. |
| `controls` | `boolean` | Shows the zoom buttons. Defaults to `true`. |
| `labels` | `{ zoomIn?, zoomOut?, reset? }` | Accessible names of the buttons. Defaults to English. |

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `scale` | Current scale, where `1` is the diagram's natural size. |
| `fit` | Scale at which the whole diagram is shown. |
| `zoomBy(factor)` | Multiplies the scale. |
| `zoomTo(scale)` | Sets the scale. |
| `reset()` | Returns to the scale that fits. |
| `refresh()` | Call after replacing the SVG in the container. |
| `destroy()` | Removes the behavior and resets the diagram. |

The buttons are in a `<div class="pele pele-zoom">` after the SVG, with the classes `pele-zoom-in`, `pele-zoom-out`, and `pele-zoom-reset`. They use the diagram's color variables. Move them with `--pele-zoom-top`, `--pele-zoom-right`, `--pele-zoom-bottom`, and `--pele-zoom-left`. The container is given `position: relative` if it is not positioned.

## parse

```ts
function parse(text: string, options?: { limit?: number; maxEdges?: number }): DiagramModel
```

Parses Mermaid text and returns the diagram model without laying it out or rendering it. Throws a `PeleError` for unsupported diagram types and syntax errors.

For a flowchart, the model has `direction`, `nodes`, `edges`, `subgraphs`, `classes`, and `tooltips`, along with `title`, `accTitle`, and `accDescr` when the source sets them.

```ts
const model = parse('flowchart LR\n  A[Start] --> B[End]');

model.direction;        // 'LR'
model.nodes.get('A');   // { id: 'A', text: 'Start', … }
model.edges.length;     // 1
```

## detectType

```ts
function detectType(text: string): DiagramType | null
```

Returns the diagram type that the text declares, or `null` if it is not a Mermaid diagram. Frontmatter, directives, and comments before the declaration are skipped.

`detectType()` identifies diagram types independently of which types are registered. `'flowchart'`, `'sequence'`, `'class'`, `'state'`, `'er'`, `'pie'`, and `'gantt'` are some of the values it returns.

```ts
detectType('graph TD\n  A --> B');           // 'flowchart'
detectType('sequenceDiagram\n  A->>B: Hi');  // 'sequence'
detectType('Hello');                         // null
```

## supports

```ts
function supports(text: string): boolean
```

Returns `true` if the text declares a diagram type that Pele can render. It does not check the rest of the syntax, so `render()` can still throw a syntax error for text that `supports()` accepts.

```ts
supports('flowchart LR\n  A --> B');         // true
supports('sequenceDiagram\n  A->>B: Hi');    // true
supports('Hello');                         // false
```

## PeleError

`render()` and `parse()` throw a `PeleError` when they cannot handle the text. It extends `Error`.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `message` | `string` | Description of the problem. Syntax errors follow the wording of Mermaid's parser errors. |
| `code` | `string` | One of the error codes below. |
| `type` | `string \| null` | The detected diagram type, when known. |
| `line` | `number` | Line of the problem, starting at 1. `0` when the error has no position. |
| `column` | `number` | Column of the problem, starting at 1. `0` when the error has no position. |
| `snippet` | `string` | The source line followed by a line that marks the column. Empty when the error has no position. |

### Error codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unsupported-diagram` | No diagram type detected, or the type is not registered. |
| `syntax` | The diagram could not be parsed. `line`, `column`, and `snippet` locate the problem. |
| `semantic` | The diagram parsed but describes something invalid. |
| `limit` | The text is longer than the `limit` option, the SVG is longer than the `outputLimit` option, a flowchart has more edges than the `maxEdges` option, or the diagram is nested too deeply to process. |

```ts
try {
  render(source);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof PeleError && error.code === 'syntax') {
    console.log(`Line ${error.line}, column ${error.column}`);
    console.log(error.snippet);
  }
}
```

## Text measurement

Pele sizes nodes from the measured width of their labels. In a browser it measures with a canvas, using the `fontFamily` and `fontFamilyMono` options. Without a canvas, such as in Node.js, it estimates widths from a built-in table of sans-serif metrics.

Pass a `measurer` to supply your own measurements.

```ts
interface TextMeasurer {
  width(text: string, size: number, style: number): number;
}
```
